# blueNOTE
**N**ational **O**pen source **T**ools for general **E**quilibrium analysis

blueNOTE is a transparent build routine which seeks to provide tools for
producing subnational economic accounts for input output or computable general
equilibrium modeling. All code and data necessary for producing subnational
accounts are provided in this repository.

Currently, the routine can produce state level accounts.

## Documentation Coming Soon ##

However, build routine files are available. These include all GAMS programs and
defines files for sets and mappings.

## Getting Started ##

Data files needed for build routine can be downloaded using the following link:

Be sure to unzip the data files into the Data directory. Note that all data
sources are provided in the batch file. Included in the data download are both
pre-processed and processed data files. All code needed for reconciliation
(GAMS and Stata) are included. The downloaded data files do not need to be
altered and will work as is.

Follow the instructions in run.bat.
